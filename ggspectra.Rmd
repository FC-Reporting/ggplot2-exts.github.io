### ggspectra
<https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ggspectra/>

ggspectra extends ggplot2 with stats, geoms and annotations suitable for light spectra. It also defines **ggplot()** and **plot()** methods specialized for the classes defined in package **photobiology** for storing different types of spectral data.

```{r, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# Example from https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ggspectra/vignettes/user-guide.html
library(ggplot2)
library(photobiology)
library(photobiologyWavebands)
library(ggspectra)

# We bind two spectra, to later on demonstrate grouping.
two_suns.spct <- rbindspct(list(sun1 = sun.spct, sun2 = sun.spct * 2))

# We change the default theme.
theme_set(theme_bw())

# ggplot() methods for spectra
ggplot(sun.spct) + geom_line()

# It is possible to the defaults by means of + and aes() as shown below.
ggplot(two_suns.spct) + aes(color = spct.idx) + geom_line()

# Several ggplot stats are defined by this package, for example:
ggplot(sun.spct) + geom_line() + 
  stat_peaks(shape = 21) + scale_fill_identity()
```
